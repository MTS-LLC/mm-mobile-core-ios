import PackageDescription

// The MinuteMaps iOS SDK, as prebuilt binaries attached to this repo's releases:
//   • MinuteMaps.xcframework — the SDK (MTS-LLC/JMap2-iOS, MinuteMaps/)
//   • MobileCore.xcframework — the shared Kotlin Multiplatform core it is compiled against (MTS-LLC/mm-web-sdk,
//     packages/mobile-core)
// Both source repos are private, so SPM can't download their release assets; this public repo hosts them.
//
// The two always ship together under one tag: MinuteMaps only works with the MobileCore build it was compiled against.
// Don't edit `version` or the checksums by hand; scripts/release.sh sets them when it publishes a release.
